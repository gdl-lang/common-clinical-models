			purpose = <"To record the assessment of a patient's A-a O2 gradient. The A-a O2 gradient is the O2 pressure difference between arteries and the aveoli. After calculating the A-a Gradient and determining if it is elevated or normal, one can rule out several causes of hypoxia.">
			use = <"Use to record assessment of A-a O2 gradient of a patient. A-a O2 gradient can help determine the cause of hypoxemia; it pinpoints the location of the hypoxia as intra- or extra-pulmonary in:
- Patients with unexplained hypoxemia;
- Patients with hypoxemia exceeding the degree of their clinical illness.

The calculated gradient should be compared to the expected gradient for patient's age, which is calculated as:
Normal Gradient Estimate in mmHg = (Age/4) + 4

The results of the gradient then can be interpreted as:
Causes of Hypoxemia 					A-a O2 Gradient Shift
V/Q Mismatch (ex: PNA, CHF, PE, ARDS, atelectasis, etc) 				Elevation
Shunt (ex: PFO, ASD, pulmonary AVMs) 				Elevation
Alveolar Hypoventilation (ex: interstitial lung dz, environmental lung dz, PCP PNA) 	Elevation
Hypoventilation (ex: COPD, CNS d/o, neuromuscular dz, etc) 			Depression
High altitude 					Depression">
