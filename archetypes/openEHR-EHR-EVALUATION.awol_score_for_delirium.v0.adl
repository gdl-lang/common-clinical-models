			use = <"The AWOL characterizes medical patients' risk for delirium at the time of hospital admission and could be used for clinical stratification and in trials of delirium prevention. The AWOL tool can be used for adult medical inpatients of all ages at high-risk for developing delirium during hospitalization. It can be completed by a nurse.
Variables and Points:
A: 
Age<80 years=0 
≥80 years=1
W:
Correctly spells “world” backward: Yes=0, No=1
O:
Oriented to city, state, county, hospital name, and floor: Yes=0, No=1
L:
Nursing illness severity assessment: Not ill=0, Mildly ill=0, Moderately ill=1,  Severely ill=1, Moribund=1. 

Formula= Addition of the selected points.

AWOL Score & Risk of delirium during hospitalization:
0= 2%
1= 4%
2= 14%
3=20%
4=64%">
