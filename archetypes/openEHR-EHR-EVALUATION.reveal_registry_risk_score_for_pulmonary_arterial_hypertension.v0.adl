			purpose = <"To store the result of assessment for REVEAL registry risk score.
REVEAL registry risk score helps stratify the patients to different risk groups and predict the 1-year survival in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).">
			use = <"It is a simplified calculator used to calculate the REVEAL Score and predict the 1-year survival in patients with PAH. 
REVEAL Score is obtained adding the selected points of the 12 variables and adding 6 to the result.
