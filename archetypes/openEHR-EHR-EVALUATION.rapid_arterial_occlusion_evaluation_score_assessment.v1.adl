			purpose = <"The purpose is to assess the RACE Score and show the sensitivity and specificity of prediction for LVO as the cause for the acute stroke.">
			use = <"The RACE Score is used to do a rapid assessment of an acute stroke patient in the prehospital setting i.e. by EMS providers. This is a quantitative assessment helping to predict the LVO (expressed using sensitivity and specificity of prediction made). The RACE Score is obtained by adding the points of all variables. 
The main variables used are Facial palsy, Arm motor impairment, Leg motor impairment, Head and gaze deviation, Hemiparesis, Agnosia (left-sided hemiparesis) and Aphasia (right-sided hemiparesis.

RACE Score interpretation: When RACE Score >=5, LVO is considered and better outcomes can be achieved if transferred to comprehensive stroke centers.

RACE Score           Sensitivity	         Specificity
≥1	              100%	             13%
≥2	               97%	             27%
≥3	               93%	             40%
≥4	              89%	             55%
≥5	              85%	             68%
≥6	            72%	            77%
≥7	             53%	            89%
≥8	             32%	            95%
9	              7%	            99%

Misuse

It is a rapid assessment tool to be used in prehospital settings while in hospitals more comprehensive assessment (NIHSS) needs to be carried out. Also, causes for neurological deficit other than LVO, for example, intracerebral hemorrhage, hypoglycemia, etc. needs to be ruled out.
