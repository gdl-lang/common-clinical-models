			purpose = <"To provide the 4-year-survival prediction for COPD patients. The tool serves as a supplementary material when discussing with patients regarding their prognosis based on a realistic and evidence-based source.">
			use = <"To be used on patients with COPD, defined as >20 pack-year smoking history and FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7, measured 20 mins after albuterol given. 

The BODE Index is calculated from four factors:
- Percentage value of predicted FEV1
- Result of 6 Minute Walk Distance
- mMRC Dyspnea Scale
- Body Mass Index (BMI).

The BODE Index will then be translated to a certain 4-year survival rate:
- index of 0-2 will have a 80% of 4-year survival rate
- index of 3-4 will have a 67% of 4-year survival rate
- index of 5-6 will have a 57% of 4-year survival rate
- index of 7-10 will have a 18% of 4-year survival rate">
			keywords = <"BODE Index", "COPD", "survival", "prediction">
			misuse = <"The tool is not to be used as to predict clinical response to therapy nor as a therapy guidance.

Do not use in the presence of these conditions:
- During acute exacerbations of COPD.
- Asthma diagnosis.
- Inability to perform bronchodilator test or 6 Minute Walk Test.
- Myocardial infarct within four months.
- Unstable angina.
- CHF (NYHA class III or IV).
- Likely to die within 3 years from a cause other than COPD.">
