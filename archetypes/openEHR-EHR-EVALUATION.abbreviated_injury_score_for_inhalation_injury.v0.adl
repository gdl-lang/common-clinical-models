			purpose = <"Used to store the evaluation of Abbreviated injury score (AIS) for inhalation injury the observation. The abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for Inhalation Injury classifies inhalation injury severity based on bronchoscopic findings and evaluate the in-Hospital survival percentage based on bronchoscopic findings.">
			use = <"Use in adult patients with suspected inhalation injury undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.

Of note, a multicenter prospective cohort study by the American Burn Association is currently underway to develop and validate a scoring system for inhalation injury based on clinical, radiographic, bronchoscopic, and biochemical parameters.


Evaluation

Interpretation:       

Grade               In-hospital Survival*

0-1                    84%

2-4                     57%">

			misuse = <"Note:

Some studies have found a non-statistically significant trend towards worse outcomes with higher AIS.
AIS severity has not been consistently associated with mortality (Sheridan 2016).
Cannot reliably predict need for high fluid resuscitation requirements.
A typical flexible bronchoscope is on average 5 mm in diameter. Hence, bronchoscopy can only identify proximal airway changes and not the narrower distal and peripheral airway changes. Thus, bronchoscopic findings cannot be fully relied upon to accurately reflect the overall severity of airway inhalation injury.">
