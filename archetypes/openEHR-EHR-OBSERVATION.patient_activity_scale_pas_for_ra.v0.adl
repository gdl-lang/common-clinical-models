The Patient Activity Scale (PAS) is a composite index of disease activity status that combines the Health Assessment Questionnaire-DI (HAQ-DI) and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and patient global assessment.
PAS = (HAQ-II x 3.33 + VAS + Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity) / 3, where:

Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)=  Averaging selected points for following variables:
HAQ-DI variables: 

Is patient able to dress and groom?
- Self-dress, including shoelaces and buttons:
-Shampoo hair:

Is patient able to arise:
- Stand up from a straight chair
- Get in and out of bed

Is patient able to eat: 
- Cut own meat
- Lift a full cup or glass to mouth
- Open a new milk carton

Is patient able to walk: 
- Walk outdoors on flat ground
- Climb up five steps

Is patient able to perform hygiene activities:
- Wash and dry body
- Take a tub bath
- Get on and off toilet

Is patient able to reach:
- Reach and get down a 5-pound object (such as a bag of sugar) from above head
- Bend down to pick up clothing from floor

Is patient able to grip: 
- Open car doors
- Open previously opened jars
- Turn faucets on and off

In each category and every answer has 4 possible values from 0 to 3. 
Values for answers: 
- Without any difficulty=0
- With some difficulty=1
- With much difficulty=2
- Unable=3


Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Patient will be asked to rate pain on a scale of 0-10, where 10 is the worst pain imaginable.

Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity: Patient will be asked to rate how well they are doing in the past week considering all the ways their disease affects them on a scale of 0-10, where 10 is the worst. 


If patient uses any aids or devices and/or requires help from another person for any given category,
 the score for that category is adjusted upward to 2. If the categorical score is already â‰¥2, the score remains unchanged.

Aids or devices used by patient:
Devices for dressing (Button hook, zipper pull)?
Devices for arising(Special or built up chair)?
Devices for eating (Built up or special utensils)?
Devices for walking (Cane, walker, crutches, wheelchair)?
Devices for hygiene activities (Raised toilet seat, bathtub seat, bathtub bar, long-handled appliances in bathroom)?
Devices for reaching (Long-handled appliances for reach)?
Devices for gripping (Jar opener (for jars previously opened))?
Answer for above questions will be rated as: Yes=1, No=0

Patient needs help from another person: 
Dressing and grooming
Arising
Eating
Walking
Hygiene activities
Reaching
Gripping and opening things
Errands and chores
Answer for above questions will be rated as: Yes=1, No=0

Interpretation:

PAS  score 0.00-0.25 = Disease activity is Remission

PAS  score 0.26-3.70 = Disease activity is Low/minimal

PAS  score 3.71-7.99 = Disease activity is Moderate

PAS score 8.00-10.00 = Disease activity is High/severe




HAQ-DI points: By selecting one of the following answers for the above questions, the relevant score will be awarded to that question:
Without any difficulty=0
With some difficulty=1
With much difficulty=2
Unable=3">
