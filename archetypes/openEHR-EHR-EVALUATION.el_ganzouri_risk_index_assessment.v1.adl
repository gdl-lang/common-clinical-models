			use = <"EGRI is a simple scoring system which helps in making preoperative stratification of patients into risk groups for difficulty in visualizing laryngeal structures during rigid laryngoscopy after induction of general anesthesia. predicts the risk level for difficult airway in a patient undergoing anesthesia. 
It is the sum of points of all the 7 variables and ranges from 0 to 12. 

Interpretation of EGRI 

EGRI  >=4   -   High Risk for difficult airway
EGRI  < 4    -    Low risk for difficult airway
