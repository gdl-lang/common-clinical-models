			use = <"Use in patients receiving immunotherapy for cancer. Patients receiving immunotherapy for cancer with signs of cytokine-mediated immunological reactions and multi-organ dysfunction.

Do not forget coagulopathy as organ dysfunction.

High-dose vasopressors need to be on board for ≥3 hours in order to be assigned grade 3.

Consider corticosteroids at 24 hours if no improvement.

Most patients receiving immunological therapies have complicated ongoing processes and require specialized care. Clinical expertise, vigilance, and frequent follow-up are key to recognizing CRS and not attributing signs and symptoms to an alternate cause (e.g. infection).">
