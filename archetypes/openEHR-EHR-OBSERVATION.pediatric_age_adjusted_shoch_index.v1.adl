			use = <"SIPA is the ratio of Maximum Heart rate to Minimum systolic BP in specific age groups. This is based on the fact that different age groups have different normal range for the vitals.

Elevated SIPA is found to be associated with higher injury severity, increased risk of mortality, blood transfusion within 24 hrs, longer hospital stay      ">
