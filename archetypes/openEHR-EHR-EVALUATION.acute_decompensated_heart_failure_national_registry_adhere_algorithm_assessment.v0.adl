			use = <"The ADHERE Algorithm estimates in-hospital mortality in admitted patients with acute decompensated HF.
This model uses 3 variables (BUN, SBP, creatinine) to classify patients, but it does not allow more precise characterization of individual risk.

The mortality rates for each risk group are as follows:

Low Risk
2.1% Mortality Risk from ADHF

Intermediate Risk 3
5.5% Mortality Risk from ADHF

Intermediate Risk 2
6.4% Mortality Risk from ADHF

Intermediate Risk 1
12.4% Mortality risk from ADHF

High Risk
21.9% Mortality Risk from ADHF">
