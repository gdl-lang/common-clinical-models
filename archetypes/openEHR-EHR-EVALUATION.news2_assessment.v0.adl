NEWS2 is interpreted as following
Score	Clinical risk	Frequency of monitoring	Response

0	Low				Minimum every 12 hrs	Assessment by a competent registered nurse or equivalent, to decide change in frequency of clinical monitoring or escalation of care

1-4	Low				Minimum every 4-6 hrs if score 1-4	Assessment by a competent registered nurse or equivalent, to decide change in frequency of clinical monitoring or escalation of care

Score of 3 in any individual pr	Low-medium	Minimum every hr	Urgent review by a ward-based doctor, to decide change in frequency of clinical monitoring or escalation of care

5-6	Medium	Minimum every hr	Urgent review by a ward-based doctor or acute team nurse, to decide if critical care team assessment is needed

≥7	High	Continuous monitoring of vital signs	Emergent assessment by a clinical team or critical care team and usually transfer to higher level of care">
