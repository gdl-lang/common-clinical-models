			purpose = <"To record the assessment of HERDOO2 Rule. The HERDOO2 Rule can help to identify low-risk women who can safely discontinue VTE treatment.">
			use = <"The HERDOO2 Rule can identify patients who have very low risk of recurrent VTE and can therefore safely stop anticoagulation in the short term.

Use with women â‰¥18 years old with unprovoked VTE.

The score can be interpreted as:

HERDOO2	Risk group	Risk of recurrent major VTE*	Recommendation

0-1	Low	3.0%				Can safely discontinue oral anticoagulation

2-4	Not low	7.4%				Continue oral anticoagulation

*Proximal DVT and segmental or greater PE, % per 100 patient years.
