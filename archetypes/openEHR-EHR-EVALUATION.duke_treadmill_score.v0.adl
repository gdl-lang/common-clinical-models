			use = <"Use on patients without known coronary artery disease undergoing treadmill EKG testing. Should be used with caution in patients undergoing testing with other protocols. 
If alternative protocol used, consider equivalent in multiples of resting oxygen consumption (METs) instead of minutes of exercise.

Duke Treadmill Score = duration of exercise, minutes – (5 × maximal net ST-segment deviation during or after exercise*, millimeters) – (4 × treadmill angina index)
*except in lead aVR
Where angina index is as follows:

Angina index / Feature: 
0/ No angina during exercise.
1/ Non-limiting angina.
2/ Patient stops exercising because of angina.">
