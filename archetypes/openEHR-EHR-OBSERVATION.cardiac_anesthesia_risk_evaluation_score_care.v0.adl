			purpose = <"Evaluate anesthesia risk for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.">
			use = <"The Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation (CARE) Score is used to as a risk classification tool to predict mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. CARE shows similar accuracy to more complex cardiac anesthesia risk assessment schematics. It does not account for age and left ventricular (LV) function. The score contains only 6 variables (compared to EuroSCORE, which contains 18 variables) but shows similar accuracy.

Scoring and interpretation is done as follows:
-Score 1. In-hospital mortality 0.5% and morbidity 5.4%. Prolonged length of stay 2.9%.
-Score 2. In-hospital mortality 1.1% and morbidity 10.3%. Prolonged length of stay 5.1%.
-Score 3. In-hospital mortality 2.2% and morbidity 19.0%. Prolonged length of stay 8.8%.
-Score 3E. In-hospital mortality 4.5% and morbidity 32.1%. Prolonged length of stay 14.7%.
-Score 4. In-hospital mortality 8.8% and morbidity 48.8%. Prolonged length of stay 23.5%.
-Score 4E. In-hospital mortality 16.7% and morbidity 65.8%. Prolonged length of stay 35.5%.
-Score 5. In-hospital mortality 29.3% and morbidity 79.6%. Prolonged length of stay 49.4%.
-Score 5E. In-hospital mortality 46.2% and morbidity 88.7%. Prolonged length of stay 63.6%.

Morbidity was defined as any of the following:
-Cardiovascular: low cardiac output, hypotension, or both treated with intraaortic balloon pump, with two or more intravenous inotropes or vasopressors for more than 24 h, or with both, malignant arrhythmia (asystole and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, antiarrhythmia therapy, or automatic cardiodefibrillator implantation
-Respiratory: mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h, tracheostomy, reintubation
-Neurologic: focal brain injury with permanent functional deficit, irreversible encephalopathy
-Renal: acute renal failure requiring dialysis
-Infectious: septic shock with positive blood cultures, deep sternal or leg wound infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, surgical debridement, or both
-Other: any surgery or invasive procedure necessary to treat a postoperative adverse event associated with the initial cardiac surgery

Examples of complex cardiac surgeries:
-Reoperation
-Combined valve and coronary artery surgery
-Multiple valve surgery
-Left ventricular aneurysmectomy
-Repair of VSD after MI
-CABG of diffuse or heavily calcified vessels
-Other, as judged by clinicians">
