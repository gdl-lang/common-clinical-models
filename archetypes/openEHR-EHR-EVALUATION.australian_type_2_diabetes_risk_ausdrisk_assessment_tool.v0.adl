The Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk (AUSDRISK) Assessment Tool identifies Australian adults at high risk for developing diabetes based on demographic, lifestyle, and simple anthropometric measures. Targeted for use in primary care screening. Enables identification of high risk individuals for focused lifestyle counseling and/or further investigation. Developed specifically for the Australian population but has allowance for ethnicity and country of birth, so it may have validity in other countries with similar demographics. Has been validated in a separate study examining an external cohort of Dutch patients. May overestimate risk in patients <25 years. Some versions of the AUSDRISK eliminate BMI, but the authors found that it resulted in a loss of discriminatory power.

Includes only non-invasive variables. Provides objective score to help support recommendations of lifestyle modification to patients by primary care physicians. In identified high-risk patients, enables further investigation and appropriate management of risk and lifestyle factors to prevent the development of diabetes. In Australia, AUSDRISK score ≥12 is a prerequisite for physician access to Medicare items for health assessment of patients in the 40-49 age group.

AUSDRISK score interpretation:
<5 - 5-year Risk of Type 2 DM 1 in 100
6-8  - 5-year Risk of Type 2 DM 1 in 50
9-11 - 5-year Risk of Type 2 DM 1 in 30
12-15 - 5-year Risk of Type 2 DM 1 in 14
16-19 - 5-year Risk of Type 2 DM 1 in 7
