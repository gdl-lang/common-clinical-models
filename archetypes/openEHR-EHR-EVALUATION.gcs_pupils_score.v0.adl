The score is calculated based on four parameters: eye response, verbal response, motor response and pupil response.

The GCS-pupils score can be interpreted as both \"Mortality at 6 months post-injury\" and \"Unfavorable outcome (vegetative state or severe disability) at 6 months post-injury\", both measured in percentage.
