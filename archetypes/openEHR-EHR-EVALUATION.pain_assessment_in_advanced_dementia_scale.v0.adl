			purpose = <"To record the assessment of the Pain assessment in advanced dementia scale.
Pain assessment in advanced dementia scale helps to assess pain in patients with dementia and elderly patients reluctant to report pain, who may potentially be in pain.
Dementia patients might not be able or be reluctant to report pain and assessing pain in advanced dementia is intuitively difficult; a validated scale can help.">
			use = <"Use for patients with advanced dementia who may potentially be in pain. Particularly useful in aphasic patients or those who cannot otherwise report degree of pain.

The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD) is a reliable assessment tool for dementia patients.

It can be used in both nonverbal and verbal patients. Valid in varying levels of cognitive impairment from mild to severe.

May also be useful in elderly patients who are reluctant to report pain, as it is more objective than self-reporting.

Interpretation:
Score	Pain assessment
1-3	Mild pain
4-6	Moderate pain
7-10	Severe pain

			misuse = <"While the tool results a continuous score between 0 and 10, there is no definitive evidence that it correlates with self-reported gradations of pain; the original study only defines 0 as “no pain” and 10 as “severe pain.” Caution should be used when titrating analgesic doses based on the score.
