Patients with advanced dementia who may potentially be in pain.

Particularly useful in aphasic patients or those who cannot otherwise report degree of pain.

Why Use:

Assessing pain in advanced dementia is intuitively difficult; a validated scale can help.


The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD) is a reliable assessment tool for dementia patients.

It can be used in both nonverbal and verbal patients.

Valid in varying levels of cognitive impairment from mild to severe.

May also be useful in elderly patients who are reluctant to report pain, as it is more objective than self-reporting.
