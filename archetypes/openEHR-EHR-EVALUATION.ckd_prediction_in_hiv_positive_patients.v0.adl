			use = <"Used to determine the probability of HIV patients developing CKD in the next 5 years, if they take tenofovir or not. The risk calculator helps determine risk of developing CKD, and may help practitioners choose patients who would be good or poor candidates for tenofovir depending on their overall CKD risks. The score was developed in a US VA patient population, and only males were included in this study. This population was also overall “healthier” than the general VA population in other cardiovascular and renal disease states, with relatively low rates of hyperglycemia or hypertension.

Score interpretation:

-Patients with low scores (0 points) may be good candidates for tenofovir.
-Patients with high scores (≥9 points) should avoid tenofovir in their treatment regimen, given their significantly higher risk of developing CKD within 5 years">
