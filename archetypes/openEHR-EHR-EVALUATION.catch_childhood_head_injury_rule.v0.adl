			purpose = <"To provide interpretation of the clinical decision rule for the use of head CT-scan in children with minor head injury.">
			use = <"To be used in minor head injury cases on patients up to 16 years of age with the following criteria:
- Initial GCS ≥13 on physician determination,
- Injury within 24 hours, AND
At least one of the following:
- Blunt trauma to the head with witnessed loss of consciousness.
- Definite amnesia.
- Witnessed disorientation.
- Vomiting two or more times at least 15 minutes apart.
- Persistent irritability in a child under two years.

CT of the head is required only for children with minor head injury* and any one of the following findings:

High risk (need for neurologic intervention)

    GCS <15 at two hours after injury.
    Suspected open or depressed skull fracture.
    History of worsening headache.
    Irritability on examination.

Medium risk (brain injury on CT scan)

    Any sign of basal skull fracture (e.g., hemotympanum, “raccoon” eyes, otorrhea or rhinorrhea of the cerebrospinal fluid, Battle’s sign).
    Large, boggy hematoma of the scalp.
    Dangerous mechanism of injury (e.g., motor vehicle collision, fall from ≥3 ft (91 cm) or 5 stairs, fall from bicycle with no helmet).
