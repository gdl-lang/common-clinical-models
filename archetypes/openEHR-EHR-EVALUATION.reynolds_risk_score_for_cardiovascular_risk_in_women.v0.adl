			use = <"Reynolds Risk Score estimates risk of adverse cardiovascular event (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, need for coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death) in women over age 45 years.
Reynolds Risk Score variables are including: age, systolic blood pressure, Diabetes mellitus, Hb A1C %, current smoker, HDL cholestrol, total cholestrol, high sensetive CRP, parent with MI before age 60 years.
Formula:  
10-year cardiovascular disease risk (%) = [1 − 0.98634(exp[B − 22.325])] × 100
where B = 0.0799 × age + 3.137 × ln(systolic blood pressure) + 0.180 × ln(high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) + 1.382 × ln(total cholesterol) −1.172 × ln(high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) + 0.134 × hemoglobin A1c (%) (if diabetic) + 0.818 (if current smoker) + 0.438 (if family history of premature myocardial infarction)

Risk Classification and  recommendations: 
Risk<5%= Unclear evidence for statin therapy
Risk 5% to <10%= Minimal benefit of statin therapy compared to risk and cost of therapy in preventing a cardiovascular event in the next ten years
Risk 10% to <20%= Discussion of lifestyle modification and initiation of statin therapy; U.S. treatment guidelines recommend initiation of treatment with 10-year risk estimates >10%;Understanding patient preference and motivation and frank discussion with patients about the risks and benefits of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular events such as stroke, MI, and CVA in female patients over the next ten years
Rsik ≥20%=Strongly recommend statin therapy in conjunction with lifestyle modification.">
