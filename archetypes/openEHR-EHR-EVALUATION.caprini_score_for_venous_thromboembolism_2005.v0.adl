Caprini Score requires face-to-face physician/patient interaction (not computer- or note-based) to obtain historical factors.
Caprini Score= Risk category= Risk percent= Recommended prophylaxis= Duration of chemoprophylaxis:
0=Lowest=Minimal= Early frequent ambulation only, OR at discretion of surgical team:Pneumatic compression devices OR graduated compression stockings=During hospitalization;
1-2= Low= Minimal= Pneumatic compression devices ± graduated compression stockings= During hospitalization;
3-4= Moderate= 0.7%= Pneumatic compression devices ± graduated compression stockings=During hospitalization;
5-6= High= 1.8%= Pneumatic compression devices AND low dose heparin OR low molecular weight heparin= 7–10 days total;
7-8= High= 4.0%= Pneumatic compression devices AND low dose heparin OR low molecular weight heparin= 7–10 days total;
≥9= Highest= 10.7%= Pneumatic compression devices AND low dose heparin OR low molecular weight heparin= 30 days total.
