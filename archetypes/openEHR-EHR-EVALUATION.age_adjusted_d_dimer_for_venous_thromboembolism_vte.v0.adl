			purpose = <"The goals of the age-adjusted D-dimer is to increase the specificity of the test in patients ≥50 years old and prevent unnecessary testing and complications. Adjusts D-dimer cutoffs by age to help rule out VTE.">
			use = <"Patients ≥50 years old presenting to emergency department as outpatients who are being worked up for PE and have low to intermediate pretest probability. Has been shown to significantly increase specificity in older populations with minimal reduction in sensitivity. Can be used for assays that report fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) with a D-dimer cutoff of 500 µg/L, or D-dimer units (DDU, less common) with a D-dimer cutoff of 250 µg/L. A value below age x 10 µg/L (5 µg/L for DDU assays) adequately rules out the need for further testing for PE in low- to intermediate-risk patients.

Note: there is currently no standard D-dimer unit of measure, and there is wide variation among labs in cutoffs reported and magnitude of unit (e.g. µg/L vs ng/mL vs µg/mL).

Interpretation:

Age-adjusted D-dimer is above cutoff. VTE diagnosis is likely. Recommendation: Consider confirmatory testing with CTA or V/Q scan.

Age-adjusted D-dimer is at or below cutoff. VTE diagnosis is unlikely. Recommendation: Consider alternative diagnosis.
