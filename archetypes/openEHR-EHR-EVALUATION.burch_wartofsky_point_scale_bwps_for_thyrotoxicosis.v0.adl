BWPS <25 is unlikely to represent thyroid storm; investigate diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis (Graves disease, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, subacute thyroiditis, exogenous levothyroxine, struma ovarii) and obtain additional imaging (thyroid ultrasound, radioactive iodine uptake and scan).
BWPS 25-44 suggests impending thyroid storm; consider thionamides, symptom management. Consider ICU monitoring.
BWPS ≥45 is highly suggestive of thyroid storm; consider rapid and aggressive multimodal management in ICU.">
