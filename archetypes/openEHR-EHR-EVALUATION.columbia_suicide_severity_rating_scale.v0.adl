The scale is calculated using two major variables:
Severity of ideation (the most severe in the past month) and Suicidal behavior (the most severe in lifetime).

Based on these Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale is assigned and interpreted as:
Suicidal ideation (most severe in the past month)				Risk of suicide	Management

1-2					Low		Behavioral health referral at discharge

3, or reported suicidal behavior in lifetime				Moderate	Behavioral health consult (psychiatric nurse/social worker) and consider patient safety precautions

4-5, or reported suicidal behavior within the past three months			High		Immediate notification of physician and/or behavioral health and patient safety precautions

Suicide risk assessment is complex, and the C-SSRS can assist clinicians with their evalulation of patients in the ER to predict their overall risk and need for admission.

Extensively validated in various patient populations, including children as young as five years old and adolescents.

Recommended and adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials (FDA 2012) and Centers for Disease Control to define and stratify suicidal ideation and behavior (Crosby 2011).">
