			use = <"Used to provide an early prognosis on injured limb at the time of admission to Emergency Department and is applied to all adult patients. 

Utilizes variables, age, limb ischemia, shock, and mechanism of injury, that are readily obtained without any complicated measurements. 

Formula:

MESS Score is calculated by addition of selected points of all the four variables. 
 
If the limb ischemia is present for > 6 hours, the limb ischemia points are doubled.

                                       contamination)     
Interpretation:
MESS Score  < 7      -      High likelihood of limb/extremity viability (predictive of salvaged limb but
                                        cases of amputation in patients with MESS Score <7 found in validation studies)
MESS Score >=7    -      Low likelihood of limb/extremity viability (100% sensitive in validation studies)

Newer surgical techniques increase the probability of limb salvage, hence a higher cut off for MESS score, perhaps 8 or 9 must be considered.
