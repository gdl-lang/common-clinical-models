			purpose = <"To record the data values for 1-year and 3-year predicted risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in individuals with atrial fibrillation. ABC-stroke risk has been validated as having significantly higher accuracy than the CHA2DS2-VASc risk model, in part because the included biomarkers are dynamic and are better indicators of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction and vascular vulnerability.">
			use = <"Use to record the 1-year and 3-year ABC-stroke risk, as percentages, determined from the ABC-stroke score. Because the ABC-stroke score is dynamic, so is the ABC-stroke risk and as a result it is useful in monitoring changes in the risk of future events (stroke or SE), as well as in the selection/personalization of antithrombotic therapy.">

					description = <"ABC-stroke risk is the predicted risk of stroke/systemic embolism (SE) in individuals with atrial fibrillation. It is derived from the ABC-stroke score which is a biomarker-based risk score calculated from the sum of points on a nomogram assigned for the individual's age [A], plasma concentration of two biomarkers [B]: cTnT-hs (cardiac troponin-T high-sensitivity) and NT-proBNP (N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide), and clinical history [C] of prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The ABC-stroke score takes a value between 0.0 - 30.0, and it is from this score that a nomogram plot for ABC-stroke risk is used to predict the 1-year and 3-year risk of stroke/SE in individuals with atrial fibrillation. An ABC-stroke score less than 4.0 predicts a 3-year risk of stroke/SE less than 1%; while the presence of a prior stroke or TIA implies a minimum score of 5.5 and 3-year risk of stroke/SE greater than 1%.">
