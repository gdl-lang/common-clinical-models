			use = <"Use in patients presenting with lower GI bleed (urgent, emergent, or primary care setting) to help determine if outpatient management is feasible.
The Oakland score could be routinely incorporated into triage pathways for acute medical and surgical admissions to identify patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding who can be safely discharged.">

			misuse = <"This is not intended to be used for clinical decision making about discharge regarding patients with other indications for hospital admission, e.g. upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
It should not be used as an absolute scale for decision making, but rather as a clinical decision support indicator.">
