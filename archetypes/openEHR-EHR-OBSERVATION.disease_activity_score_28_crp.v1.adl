					description = <"Disease activity score 28-CRP (DAS28-CRP) is a calculated score for assessing disease activity in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is calculated from a formula using four parameters: the number of tender (0 - 28) and swollen (0 - 28) joints the patient has, the patient global assessment of disease activity (on a visual analogue scale 0.0 -10.0), and the patient's circulating level of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP).">
