			purpose = <"To record the variables, Facial palsy, Arm motor impairment, Leg motor impairment, Head and gaze deviation, Hemiparesis, Agnosia (left-sided hemiparesis) and Aphasia (right-sided hemiparesis) and total score (RACE Score)">
			use = <"The RACE Score is used to do a rapid assessment of an acute stroke patient in the prehospital setting i.e. by EMS providers. This is a quantitative assessment helping to predict the LVO (expressed using sensitivity and specificity of prediction made). The RACE Score is obtained by adding the points of all variables. 

Variables                                          0                                1                               2

Facial Palsy                             Normal or Mild           Moderate                      Severe

impairment
Leg motor                                Normal or Mild           Moderate                     Severe
impairment 
Head and Gaze                            Absent                     Present
Deviation 
Hemiparesis                                  Left                          Right
Agnosia(left-sided         Patient recognizes his/her   Does not recognize     Does not recognize 
hemiparesis)                  arm and impairment            his/her arm or              his/her arm or 
                                                                                    impairment                 impairment
Aphasia (right-sided       Performs both tasks           Performs one task        performs neither tasks
Hemiparesis)                     correctly                          correctly    

RACE Score interpretation: When RACE Score >=5, LVO is considered and better outcomes can be achieved if transferred to comprehensive stroke centers.
