			purpose = <"To report the patient's self-assessment of how well they are doing, despite ongoing rheumatoid arthritis.">
			use = <"Use to record the patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGDA) using a visual analogue scale (VAS). PtGDA rates the subjective perception of \"how well the patient is doing\" on a VAS between 0.0 = very well (low disease activity) and 10.0 = very poor (high disease activity). The VAS has intervals of 0.5 so that PtGDA can take any of the values: 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 ... 10.0 with unit as 'cm'.
PtGDA is a component measure in the calculation of simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI). PtGDA is also a component measure in the calculation of disease activity score (DAS28), but with a VAS between 0.0 = very well (low disease activity) and 100.0 = very poor (high disease activity) with unit as 'mm'.">
