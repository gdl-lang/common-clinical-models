			purpose = <"To provide interpretation of the chance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in CHC patients based on APRI.">
			use = <"APRI is calculated based on the following formula:
APRI = ((AST / AST Upper Limit of Normal) x 100) / Platelet count
The measurement unit for AST and AST Upper Limit of Normal is IU/L and for platelet count is in 10^9/L.

The interpretation is based on the 2011 meta-analysis in Hepatology by Lin et. al.
Significant fibrosis: APRI threshold of 0.7 was 77% sensitive and 72% specific.
Severe fibrosis: APRI threshold of 1.0 was 61% sensitive and 64% specific. APRI of >=2 was 36% sensitive and 93% specific.
Cirrhosis: APRI threshold of 1.0 was 76% sensitive and 72% specific. APRI of >=2 was 46% sensitive and 91% specific.
