Why use
QT interval prolongation increases the risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP), a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which is life-threatening and often fatal.

			misuse = <"There are many known factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation; the ones included in this score were found to be the most predictive, but others should not be ignored. Some of the other common risks include:

Other electrolyte abnormalities like hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia

Inadequate dose adjustment for patients with acute or chronic kidney dysfunction

Drug-drug interactions

CredibleMeds.org provides an outstanding comprehensive list of clinical risk factors for QT prolongation. 

CredibleMeds.org also provides a comprehensive list of drugs that may cause QT prolongation.

Drug-drug interactions should always be considered when prescribing multiple medications; this score does not include pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

This score also does not consider dosing adjustments for renally-eliminated drugs.

Clinicians should always try to avoid QT-prolonging medications when possible.

Maintaining normal electrolyte levels can help reduce the risk of QT prolongation as well.

Patients with very poor ejection fractions (<20%) are particularly high risk for QT prolongation.
