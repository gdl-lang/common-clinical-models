The DIRE score for Opioid Treatment is calculated from 7 parameters: Diagnosis, Intractability, Psychological risk, Chemical health risk, Reliability risk, Social support risk and Efficacy. 

Interpretation: 
DIRE Score:                   Candidacy for long-term opioid analgesia:
7-13                              Not a suitable candidate
