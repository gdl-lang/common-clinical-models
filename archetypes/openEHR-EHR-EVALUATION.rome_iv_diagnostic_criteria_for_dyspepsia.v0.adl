			purpose = <"To provide diagnostic criteria dan evaluation of functional dyspepsia.">
			use = <"As an evaluation tool for patient suspected of functional dyspepsia. 
In order to fulfill the diagnostic criteria, the patient must have at least 1 of following symptoms which is bothersome for ≥3 months with the onset of ≥6 months ago:
- postprandial fullness  ≥3 days/week, 
- early satiation  ≥3 days/week, 
- epigastric pain  ≥1 day/week, 
- epigastric burning  ≥1 day/week, and

another separated criteria which is mandatory for the fulfillment of a functional dyspepsia diagnosis:
- no evidence of organic, systemic, metabolic or structural disease likely to support other diagnosis.

Further criteria are used to evaluate the subtype of the functional dyspepsia:
- The presence of bothersome postprandial fullnesss and/or early satiation ≥3 days/week would suggest the Postprandial Distress Syndrome (PDS) subtype
- The presence of bothersome epigastric pain and/or burning ≥1 day/week would suggest the Epigastric Pain Syndrome (EPS) subtype
- The presence of both would suggest the coexistance of both PDS and EPS subtypes.
