			purpose = <"the CCI is a good prognostic tool for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients based in age, serum albumin and upto 19 other comorbid conditions to give an estimate of the 1 and 2 year survival rates. It is an easier to use tool in non-research settings.">
			use = <"The CCI score originally only contained the aggregate score of the 19 comorbid conditions and did not account for age or serum albumin level. 

This version includes these factors as they show an independent effect on 1 and 2-year survival rates in patients going through dialysis and ESRD. 

The core score ranges from 0 to 37 and age adds a score of 1 for each decade > 40 years of age for which an age of 120 yrs. (to account for outliers) produces a maximum possible score of 45.

The factors in the core score are weighted differently according to how much of a contribution they have to the survival rates. There are 10 comorbid conditions scored with 1, 6 scored with 2, 1 scored with 3 and 2 conditions scored with 6.

The serum albumin level is corrected per the lower limit of albumin (LLA) if the value is less than 3.5 g/dl using the equation to get the serum albumin factor: 3.5/LLA. 

The serum albumin factor is then used to categorise the CMI results [grouped into 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and >8 scores] to generate the 1 and 2-year survival probability rates [<=3.5g/dl and >3.5g/dl] but does not affect the CCI core score itself.

More information on deriving the probability score is shown on (1)
