A Pediatric Trauma score <=8 is considered as life-threatening and requires transfer to a pediatric trauma center or highest level of care available in the area. On the other hand, score >8 is considered to be less life-threatening and thus can be treated at the receiving facility while also performing further assessment on the patient's condition.">
