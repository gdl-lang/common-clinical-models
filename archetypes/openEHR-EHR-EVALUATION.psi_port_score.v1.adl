			purpose = <"To provide prediction rule to help physicians in making rational decisions about hospitalization for patients with community acquired pneumonia.">
			use = <"In step 1 of the prediction rule, the following were independently associated with mortality: 
-an age of more than 50 years, 
- each of five coexisting illnesses (neoplastic disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, and liver disease), and 
-meach of five physical examination findings (altered mental status; pulse, >125 per minute; respiratory rate, >30 per minute; systolic blood pressure, <90 mm Hg; and temperature, <35°C or >40°C). 
Should any of those conditions is presence, then the patient will be assigned to risk class II-IV accoding to the step 2 of the prediction rule. Otherwise, the patient is assigned to risk class 1.

In step 2, in addition to the 11 factors identified in step 1, other factors are taken into consideration:
- 2 demographic factors (sex and nursing home residence) ,
- 7 laboratory or radiographic findings (blood urea nitrogen concentration >30 mg per deciliter [11 mmol per liter]; glucose concentration >250 mg per deciliter [14 mmol per liter]; hematocrit <30 percent; sodium concentration <130 mmol per liter; partial pressure of arterial oxygen <60 mm Hg; arterial pH <7.35; and pleural effusion) 

All the factors in step 1 and step 2 are summed to measure risk class and its magnitude of association with mortality rate.
