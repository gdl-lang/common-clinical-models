				purpose = <"It is intended to identify individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and assess the severity of anxiety symptoms using a 7-item self-reported questionnaire (GAD-7).">
				use = <"Used to screen individuals for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) based on the individual's health status in the past 2 weeks. Also used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms and their change over time. May be used to screen individuals for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

The GAD-7 scale consists of 7 questions with answers scored on a 4-point Likert scale:
(0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day). 

The total score is the sum of the scores on all 7 items and gives a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 21. 
Scores of 5, 10 and 15 are cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety respectively. Further evaluation of the individual is recommended with a total score of 10 or greater.">
