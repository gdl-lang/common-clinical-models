The formula used arises from work done by Payne et al and is given as; corrected calcium = serum calcium  + 0.8 * [(40 - serum albumin) / 10], where calcium measurements are in mg/dl, measured serum albumin is in g/L and 40 (g/L) is the assumed population normal for albumin. 
This guide only accepts input albumin measurements as g/L. 
To convert from g/dl to g/L, multiply by ten (10).">

						text = <"Calcium Corrected">
						description = <"Corrected calcium is the total calcium concentration in an individual when adjusted for the presence of hypoalbuminaemia in that individual. Because serum calcium (part of total calcium concentration) is principally bound to the plasma protein albumin, when levels of albumin are low it results in a falsely low total calcium concentration. The Payne formula performs the necessary adjustments to determine the actual total calcium concentration in individuals with hypoalbuminaemia: corrected calcium = serum calcium  + 0.8 * [(40 - serum albumin) / 10]. Serum calcium is measured in mg/dl, serum albumin is measured in g/L and 40 in the equation refers to 40 g/L which is the assumed population normal for albumin.">
