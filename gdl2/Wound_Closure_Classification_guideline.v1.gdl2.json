If well-vascularized, may be closed up to 24 hours after trauma.\n\n\nSignificant tissue loss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, devitalized edges, ulcerations, or abscess cavities.= Secondary= No surgical closure. Daily dressing changes. Consider negative pressure vacuum therapy.\n\n\nGrossly contaminated wounds with or without significant tissue loss, e.g. contaminated by soil or feces, animal bites, projectiles.= Tertiary (Delayed Primary)= Thoroughly explore, irrigate, and debride. Observe for 3-7 days before surgical closure or skin grafting. May benefit from negative pressure vacuum therapy.\n\n\n",
