        "use": "This screening tool serves as a checklist of 10 items (with care to read on the detailed instructions per item) and is not intended to be numerically scored and is not designed to issue a total score. It helps to ensure clinicians account for all important items that might reflect a high level of risk. Therefore, in daily clinical practice, the screen is not summed. Invalidation, numerical values were used and for the sake of modeling, this convention has also been used in this model with: No = 0 Maybe/moderate = 1 Yes = 2 \"Do not know\" has been given the ordinal value = 3 and as this tool does not look at the value per se, this has been allowed. Once the 10 questions have been answered - there are a further 3 selections that can be made. The clinician can then record his/her evaluation into Low, Moderate or High based on their clinical knowledge and further evaluate their thoughts on whether further investigation for risk should be conducted and if so - to choose to implement preventative procedures ",
